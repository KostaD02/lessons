          As a lecturer at <a href="https://ge.itstep.org/">IT Academy Step</a>,
          I find myself working with different groups regularly. Each time, I am
          required to create a new repository on GitHub and subsequently delete
          it after the lesson. Therefore, I have contemplated the idea of
          consolidating all these repositories into a single location. The
          purpose of this repository is to house some of my lessons from various
          steps, which I have chosen to publish for educational purposes. It is
          important to note that every piece of code is crafted with the
          intention of providing students with a hands-on experience based on
          these lessons.
